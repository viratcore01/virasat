              Virasat is a secure storage and delivery tool only. It does NOT replace a legal Will, Trust,
              or court-mandated succession process. We do not provide legal advice. Users must consult a
              qualified lawyer for estate planning and succession under applicable Indian laws (Hindu Succession
              Act, Muslim Personal Law, Indian Succession Act, etc.). Virasat delivers your encrypted data
              and instructions to designated beneficiaries after verified death. Actual ownership transfer of
              assets (bank accounts, property, crypto, etc.) follows standard legal procedures.

            <p>
              By accessing or using Virasat ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
              If you do not agree, do not use the Service. These terms apply to all users, including
              beneficiaries and executors who receive notifications.

            <p>
              Virasat provides a digital legacy vault service that allows users to securely store information
              about their assets and deliver messages to designated beneficiaries upon verified death. The
              service uses zero-knowledge encryption — meaning your data is encrypted in your browser and
              we cannot access it.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              The Service includes:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc pl-6 mt-2">

                Virasat is NOT a legal will, NOT legal advice, and does NOT create legally binding
                instruments for asset transfer. The Service only stores and delivers information. Actual
                inheritance requires valid legal documentation per applicable Indian laws:
