# COMPLIANCE.md — Virasat Legal Position & Roadmap

## Status: Hackathon MVP — NOT YET LEGALLY REVIEWED

**Crucial**: This document summarises our current legal position. Consult a qualified lawyer before any public launch.

---

## 1. LAYERED TRUST MODEL: Link to /legal

- `/legal` must be **the single source of truth** for trust boundaries.
- Every other legal page MUST link to `/legal` first.
- Prevent trust drift by treating `/legal` as canonical.

## 1a. TRUST BOUNDARY — What Virasat MUST NOT Claim

Virasat is a secure storage and delivery tool only.  
It does NOT replace a legal Will, Trust, or court-mandated succession process.  
Actual ownership transfer of assets follows standard legal procedures and requires valid legal documentation.

Virasat does NOT provide legal advice.  
Users must consult a qualified lawyer for estate planning and succession under applicable Indian laws.

No page or UI element may imply or state that Virasat:
- is a legal Will, trust, or inheritance service
- replaces lawyers, notaries, or courts
- guarantees asset transfer
- supersedes Indian personal laws (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Jain)
- provides legal advice or testamentary instructions

## 1b. TRUST BOUNDARY — What Virasat MUST Provide

Virasat MUST remain a **secure digital vault and delivery tool** only:
- encrypts and stores asset/message data (zero-knowledge)
- delivers encrypted data to beneficiaries only after verified death
- provides executor verification and waiting-period workflows
- documents intent, but does not replace legal instruments
